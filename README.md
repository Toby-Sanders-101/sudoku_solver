# sudoku_solver
Python program that can solve 'most' sudoku challenges.

This is a very simply program - it requires no unusual modules, constructs or functions (other than many recursions and arrays).

It is not the easiest to understand initially, however, with the right IDE and debugging tools, it can be figured out.
